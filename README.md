<h3 align="center">Desenvolve GB - Trilha Full Stack</h3>

<em>I’m currently studying to become a DEV full stack -  **PROGRAMA DESENVOLVE 2023 - Grupo Boticário** - and here is kind of all the inital projects I'm using for practicing while taking those courses online on Alura Platform.

I used some ideas from the courses examples, but I am also trying to change the topic (at least) to produce some "new" projects by my own. I hope "you" enjoy taking a look at this.</em>
